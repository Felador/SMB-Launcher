## [1.0.1.1] - 2019-06-19
### Added
Can now check if the user has an internet connection. Could be used in the future.

### Changed

### Fixed
Sound no longer plays when the MainForm opens (caused by setting the useanalog checked event link and then setting the value to loaded data which triggered it).
Skips checking for a new version if there is no internet connection.
